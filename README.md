Developer Simulator Game

Overview
The Developer Simulator is an interactive simulation game that challenges players to balance their energy, happiness, and bug count while working toward the goal of becoming a legendary developer. The goal of the game is to write code with the fewest number of clicks (which represents time passing), all while managing burnout, fixing bugs, and keeping your mental well-being ("happiness") intact.

In this game, you will simulate a developer's daily tasks, such as writing code, fixing bugs, taking breaks, and drinking coffee. Each action affects your energy and happiness levels, while progress is tracked by the number of lines of code you've written. The game ends when you either burn out or reach the goal of writing a specific number of lines of code.

Features
Energy & Happiness Management: Keep track of your energy and happiness as you work. If either goes to zero, you lose the game!

Code Progress: Write code to move closer to your goal of becoming a legendary developer (1000 lines of code written).

Bug Fixing: Fix bugs that slow down your progress. Each fix requires energy and may impact happiness.

Breaks & Coffee: Take breaks to regain happiness and energy. Coffee boosts your energy but only adds a small amount to your happiness.

Game Over: The game ends when your energy or happiness reaches zero (loss), or when you've written the target amount of code (win).

How to Play
Write Code: Writing code decreases energy and happiness but adds to your progress toward the goal. The more you write, the closer you get to becoming a legendary developer!

Fix Bugs: Bugs will accumulate as you write code. Fix them to reduce the bug count, but it takes energy and could also decrease your happiness.

Take Breaks: Taking breaks will increase your happiness and energy, but it will cost you time.

Drink Coffee: Drinking coffee boosts energy and provides a small happiness boost, but it will cost you time.

The game continues until you either reach the code goal or burn out. Can you become a legendary developer with the fewest clicks?
